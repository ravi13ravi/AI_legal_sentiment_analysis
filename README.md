### Phase 1: Foundation of Programming (1-2 months)
Before you dive into complex topics, it’s crucial to strengthen your programming fundamentals.

1. **Choose a Programming Language**: 
   - Start with **C** or **Python**. **C** is great for understanding low-level concepts, while **Python** is beginner-friendly and used widely in various fields.
   - Python is especially great for Data Science, Web Development, and Automation. Choose **Python** if you are looking for a versatile and high-demand skill.

2. **Understand the Basics**:
   - **Variables, Data Types** (int, float, char, string)
   - **Control Structures** (if, else, loops)
   - **Functions** (how to define and call them)
   - **Arrays/Lists**
   - **Basic Input and Output**

   Resources:
   - [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
   - [Learn C Programming](https://www.learn-c.org/)
   - Online Courses: Udemy, Coursera (e.g., "CS50: Introduction to Computer Science" or "Python for Everybody")

3. **Practice Coding**:
   - Use **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, **CodeSignal**, or **Codewars** for basic problems.
   - Aim to solve 10-15 problems a week. Start with easy-level problems and gradually move to medium-level.

### Phase 2: Data Structures and Algorithms (3-4 months)
A strong foundation in **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** is crucial for software development and competitive programming. Mastering these will allow you to solve complex problems efficiently.

1. **Core Data Structures**:
   - **Arrays**
   - **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly)
   - **Stacks and Queues**
   - **Hash Tables**
   - **Trees** (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
   - **Graphs** (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
   - **Heaps and Priority Queues**
   - **Trie** (important for some advanced applications)

2. **Key Algorithms**:
   - **Sorting Algorithms** (Bubble, Merge, Quick, Insertion)
   - **Searching Algorithms** (Linear Search, Binary Search)
   - **Dynamic Programming** (Fibonacci, Knapsack, LCS)
   - **Greedy Algorithms**
   - **Graph Algorithms** (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, BFS/DFS)

3. **Practice**:
   - Solve problems on **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and **GeeksforGeeks**.
   - Try to solve at least 5-10 problems per day.
   - Participate in **Competitive Programming** contests on platforms like **Codeforces** or **TopCoder**.

### Phase 3: Object-Oriented Programming (1-2 months)
In your 3rd year, understanding **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** will set you apart in building modular and scalable applications.

1. **Core Concepts of OOP**:
   - **Classes and Objects**
   - **Encapsulation** (Hiding data)
   - **Inheritance** (Creating subclasses)
   - **Polymorphism** (Overloading and Overriding)
   - **Abstraction** (Defining interfaces)

2. **Language-Specific OOP**:
   - If you're learning Python, study Python’s OOP features (e.g., `class`, `__init__`, inheritance).
   - If you’re focusing on Java, focus on how Java handles OOP principles.

3. **Practice**:
   - Build small projects using OOP principles.
   - Work on projects like **Banking System** or **Inventory Management System**.
   - Take online coding challenges focused on OOP concepts.

### Phase 4: Advanced Topics and Specialization (4-6 months)
Now that you’ve mastered the basics and intermediate topics, it’s time to branch into more advanced areas based on your interests and future career goals.

#### 1. **Web Development (Full-Stack)**:
If you want to get into web development, focus on the following:
   - **Frontend**: Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Angular, or Vue.js).
   - **Backend**: Learn about web frameworks (Flask/Django for Python, Node.js for JavaScript).
   - **Databases**: Learn SQL and NoSQL databases (MySQL, MongoDB).
   - **Version Control**: Learn Git and GitHub for code collaboration.

#### 2. **Mobile App Development**:
   - **Android**: Learn **Kotlin** and Android Studio.
   - **iOS**: Learn **Swift** and Xcode.
   - **Cross-platform**: Consider learning **Flutter** or **React Native**.

#### 3. **Data Science & Machine Learning**:
   - **Python** is the most commonly used language for this field.
   - Learn libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**.
   - Learn Machine Learning concepts like regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks.
   - Dive into deep learning frameworks like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.
